## A little bit about me

I am currently a computer science student, but with my passion for programming, I started coding way before attending university. I'm primarily doing web development, but I am interested in learning more about all kinds of programming . including but not limited to Desktop development, game development, Data Science.

I enjoy using my obsessive need for perfection to create something that is both beautiful and functional. I am always looking for new ways to improve my code and learn new things.

**Talking about Personal Stuffs:**

- 👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently working on a university project that is essentially a AutoMobile service & product management system but with a twist along with my group members.
