## A little bit about me

I am currently a computer science student, but with my passion for programming, I started coding way before attending university. I'm primarily doing web development, but I am interested in learning more about machine learning and data science.Trying a have a look at cross platform desktop development too :sweat_smile:.

I enjoy using my obsessive need for perfection to create something that is both beautiful and functional. I am always looking for new ways to improve my code and learn new things.

**Talking about Personal Stuffs:**

- 👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently working on a project that is essentially a modern Resource Management System for my university batch mates.I want to help them and myself to manage our time and resources efficiently and easily

- 🚀 I’m currently experimenting with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org);
